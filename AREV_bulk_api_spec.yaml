    # Introduction
    The AREV Bulk Load API allows you to load your transactional and configuration data into AREV. AREV Bulk
    Load API is built using REST principles, which provide predictable URLs that make it easy to write applications. 
    This API follows HTTP rules, so a wide range of HTTP clients can be used to interact with the API.
    
    # Authentication
    All AREV Bulk Load API endpoints require authentication using credentials in the HTTP headers. You can pass credentials as:
    
    * `--user` username: password option
    * An extra `--header` option with the proper authentication method and `username:password` combination encoded in Base64. 

    To get credentials, contact the AREV CloudOps team
    
    # Connections
    
    Only SSL connections are allowed in AREV API endpoints. Communicating over SSL protects user privacy by encrypting information between a user and the AREV API.
    
    # Error Codes
    
    The AREV API returns [HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) for every request:
    
    | Code | Text              | Description                                                            |
    |------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | 200  | OK                | Success.                                                               |
    | 204  | No Content        | The server received the request but the request is empty.              |
    | 304  | Not Modified      | There is no new data to return.                                        |
    | 400  | Bad Request       | The request is invalid or cannot be processed. For further details, refer to the accompanying error message.|
    | 401  | Unauthorized      | Authentication credentials are missing or incorrect. Also returned in other circumstances, for example, all calls to API v1 endpoints return 401.                                                                             |
    | 403  | Forbidden         | The request is understood, but it is rejected or access is not allowed. For further details, refer to the accompanying error message. This code is used when requests are rejected due to update limits.                      |
    |      |                   | The URI requested is invalid or the resource requested, such as a user, does not exist. Also returned when the requested format is not supported by the requested method.                                                     |
    | 406  | Not Acceptable    | Returned by the Search API when an invalid format is specified in the request.                                                                                                                                                |
    | 410  | Gone              | This resource no longer exists. Used to indicate that an API endpoint is turned off. For example: “The Revstream REST API v1 will soon stop functioning. Please migrate to API v1.1.”                                         |
    | 500  | Internal Server Error | Something is wrong. Contact the AREV Support team to investigate.                                                                                                                                                               |
    # Error Responses
    
    If the data sent to AREV in the request body of the POST method does not pass data validation, the returned response has the HTTP status code of 400 and the response body has a list of error messages.
    
    The validation process allows you to make sure that the value you enter in a field is valid. If it is not, you get an error message. AREV Bulk Load API generates the following types of error messages:

    * Required field validation. If you do not fill out the field, you will get the "<Field> must be specified." message.
    * Maximum length validation. If you exceed the maximum number of characters allowed in a field, you will get the "<Field> can be up to and including <max> alphanumeric characters." message.
    * Date format validation. If you use a date format different than YYYY-MM-DD, you will get the "<Field> has an incorrect date format" message.
    * Numeric value format validation. If you enter a field with a value different than the number, you will get the "<Field> has invalid numeric format." message.
    * Predefined values validation. Some fields have predefined values. For further details, refer to the Valid Values column in Staging Tables Mapping or FX Rates Upload, respectively. If you enter an incorrect value, you will get "<Field> must be <comma separated list of the allowable values>." message.
    
    # Pagination
    
    AREV provides APIs to retrieve lists of revenue schedules and other resources that are paginated to 3000 items by default. 
    
    The `pageNumber` should be specified in the URL as a query string parameter. For example: 

    `http://revstreamcloud.com:883/connector/v2018.1/revenueSchedulesOut/getExported?orgId=1&trackerId=1&pageNumber=2`
